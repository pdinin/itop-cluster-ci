# itop-cluster-ci

Extensions for Combodo's ITIL Solution:   iTop (<http://www.combodo.com/itop)>

This extension began it's life when lndevnull created it and then I have extended and changed portions. Very good work indeed lndevnull.
See the excellent original work at <https://github.com/lndevnull/itop-extensions.>

This extension implements some new cluster related classes and extends some of the installed classes.

## New and Extended classes

These new Classes are visible and useable from the iTop web interface.

* MiddlewareCluster (new)
* DBCluster (new)
* WebCluster (new)
* Middleware (extended)
* DBServer (extended)
* WebServer (extended)
* Database Schema (extended)
* Web Application
* Load Balancer
* LB Address

### DBServer / DBCluster / Database Schema

DBServer and DBCluster comes from the original work.

The DBCluster also has a new Software definition for use in the Software catalogue.

The original extension renamed Database Schema to DB Instance but I have reverted this and kept the original definition from iTop.

#### Middleware

Middleware is the extended with a new Tab called Middleware Clusters where clusters the Middleware is part of is listed.

Based off of wortk by Roger Martensson

#### MiddlewareCluster

MiddlewareCluster is a new class that is supposed to define an installed cluster. In iTop this object is defined to connect 1 or more Middleware as part of a cluster.

The MiddlewareCluster is based on the SoftwareInstance interface like the Middleware. Although with some extensions.

The is a Tab where Middleware are listed as being part of the MiddlewareCluster object.
The Software entry can be used to describe what Cluster software is used but if needed.

Cluster Type is used to define what type of cluster it is. It is a radio button choice.

#### DBServer

DBServer is the extended with a new Tab called DB Clusters where clusters the DBServer is part of is listed.

#### DBCluster

DBCluster is a new class that is supposed to define an installed cluster. In iTop this object is defined to connect 1 or more DBServers as part of a cluster.

The DBCluster is based on the SoftwareInstance interface like the DBServer. Although with some extensions.

The is a Tab where DBServers are listed as being part of the DBCluster object.
The Software entry can be used to describe what Cluster software is used but if needed.

Cluster Type is used to define what type of cluster it is. It is a radio button choice.

From the original work of lndevnull there is a tab to describe Logical Volumes this cluster object is using.

#### Database Schema

Database Schema is extended with support for choosing a DBCluster or a DBServer.

For REST-users do note that dbserver_id and dbserver_name is removed from DatabaseSchema. Please use softwareinstance_id and
softwareinstance_name.

### WebServer / WebCluster / Web Application

The WebCluster also has a new Software definition for use in the Software catalogue.

#### WebServer

WebServer is the extended with a new Tab called Web Clusters where clusters the WebServer is part of is listed.

#### WebCluster

WebCluster is a new class that is supposed to define an installed cluster. In iTop this object is defined to connect 1 or more WebServers as part of a cluster.

The DBCluster is based on the SoftwareInstance interface like the WebServer. Although with some extensions.

The is a Tab where WebServers are listed as being part of the WebCluster object.
The Software entry can be used to describe what Cluster software is used but if needed.

Cluster Type is used to define what type of cluster it is. It is a radio button choice.

#### Web Application

Web Applicaton is extended with support for choosing a WebCluster or a DBServer.

Also from the original work from lndevnull, there is a tab for adding Database Schemas.

For REST-users do note that webserver_id and webserver_name is removed from WebApplication. Please use softwareinstance_id and
softwareinstance_name.
Also from the original work from lndevnull, there is a tab for adding Database Schemas.

### LoadBalancer / LBAddress
Two new classes that can be used to document and describe relations with a
Load Balancer.

#### LoadBalancer
LoadBalancer is used to describe the logical instance that is the functional load balancer. This can be seen as the software that runs Load Balancer.

The FunctionalCI that the software is run on is later documented as their own CI and then connected to the LoadBalancer class as Nodes.

#### LBAddress
The Load Balancer is seen as the software that balances an address. The address
is documented as a LBAddress CI. This CI must be connected to a LoadBalancer but can also be connected to a SoftwareInstance.
